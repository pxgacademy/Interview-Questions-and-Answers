✅ JavaScript Basics
### _#01._ 🟡 What is JavaScript and why is it used?
জাভাস্ক্রিপ্ট একটা **programming language**, যেটা ওয়েবসাইটে **interactive** ফিচার তৈরি করতে use হয় — যেমন: button click করলে কিছু হওয়া, data load হওয়া, animations, ইত্যাদি।

এইটা **browser-এর ভিতরে run করে**, আর ওয়েবপেজে **dynamic behavior** অ্যাড করতে help করে।

উদাহরণ হিসেবে ধরেন, একটা ফর্মে user কিছু লিখছে, সাথে সাথে validation দেখানো — এইটাও JavaScript দিয়েই হয়।

তাই JavaScript use করা হয় mainly **user experience enhance করার জন্য** এবং **frontend behavior control করার জন্য**।



### _#02._ 🟡 What is the difference between JavaScript and other programming languages?
JavaScript এর কিছু unique feature আছে, যেটা অন্য অনেক language থেকে একে আলাদা করে তোলে।

**প্রথমত**, JavaScript মূলত **browser-based language** — মানে এটা আগে শুধু browser-এর ভিতরে run করত। এখন অবশ্য Node.js এর মাধ্যমে **server-side**-এও run হয়।

**দ্বিতীয়ত**, JavaScript একটা **dynamically typed language**, মানে variable declare করার সময় type define করতে হয় না — automatically বুঝে ফেলে। কিন্তু Java, C++, এসব হচ্ছে **statically typed** — সেখানে type declare করতেই হয়।

**তৃতীয়ত**, JavaScript support করে **event-driven**, **asynchronous programming**, যেখানে অনেক কাজ background-এ চলতে পারে — যেমন API call, file load ইত্যাদি — যেটা অনেক language-এ সহজভাবে করা যায় না।

**আরো একটা বড় পার্থক্য**, JavaScript এর **prototype-based inheritance**, যেখানে Java বা C++ use করে **class-based inheritance**। এখন অবশ্য JavaScript-এ class keyword আছে, but internally still prototype-ই।

তো সংক্ষেপে বললে, JavaScript mainly used হয় **web-based dynamic functionality** build করার জন্য, যেখানে অন্যান্য language গুলো general-purpose বা অন্য type-এর application-এর জন্য use হয়।

# ✨ JavaScript based interview questions

_#08._ You have a API that fetches a user's details, but it sometimes takes a long time to respond. You need to show a loading spinner waiting for the API response and hide it once the data is fetched. How would you implement this?

_#14._ How would you handle a situation where two APIs depend on each other. for example, imagine you're building a social media app, The first API fetches for user content like user name, host content etc. and the second API fetches the likes and comments for that post. now what if the first API fails, how would you ensure the second API only runs if the first one is successful?

# ✨ React based interview questions

_#02._ What are the rules of `hooks` in react?
_Ans:_ There are 3 rules of `hooks`

1. **Top-Level Only:** use `hooks` at the top level of your `functional components`. not inside `loops`, `conditions`, or `nested functions`.
2. **React Functions Only:** call `hooks` only from react `functional components`, or `custom hooks`. not from regular javascript functions.
3. **No Conditions:** call hooks unconditionally at the top level without any `if-else` statements or conditions.

_#05._ You have a table with hundreds of rows. How can you efficiently handle a click event on every row without adding an event listener to each row?
_/ event delegation, event bubbling /_

_#07._ You need to implement an infinite scrolling feature in a react application where more data loads as the user scrolls down. How would you achieve this?

_#08._ You need to render a list of 10,000 items in the react application, but rendering all items at once causes performance issues. How would you optimize this? _/ virtualization /_

_#10._ You have a search bar that fetches from an API. The problem is that API is called every time the user types a letter which overloads the server with unnecessary request. How would you optimize this?

_#11._ You have a login page where the user loges in successfully. But as soon as user refreshes the page, they get logged out. Why does this happen and how would you fix it?

_#15._ Imagine you're building a social media platform like facebook. Now you want to let users switch between newest first and oldest first comments using a dropdown. How would you implement this features?

_#16._ Imagine you're building a web page that shows data from an API. If the API fails due to bad internet or server error. How will you handle it?

_#17._ Imagine you're building a gmail like app. when a user delete an email instead of removing it instantly you app should show a small message like "Message will delete in 5s, Undo?" this message should stay visible for 5 seconds and giving the user a chance to cancel. how would you implement this undo delete feature in your code?

_#18._ Imagine you're building a YouTube style app, when a user uploads a video, you need to show a real time upload progress like 0% to 100%. How would you implement this live progress bar UI plus backend upload logic in react?

_#19._ You have a submit button in your form. But when the user clicks multiple times quickly, your API gets called again and again. How can you prevent multiple API calls on repeated button clicks in react?

_Ans:_ To solve this, I'll follow these steps.

- **step 1:** use a loading state like isSubmitting. to track if the API call is already in progress, while it's true disable the button, so the user can't click again.
- **step 2:** we can also use use ref to store a flag that prevents repeated submission without rerendering.
- **step 3:** for more advanced control. apply a debounce method to delay the function call. If clicks happen rapidly.
